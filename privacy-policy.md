# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: August 29, 2025_

Thank you for using Akahidegn ("we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## Information We Collect

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App includes:

### Personal Data
- We do **not** collect personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., by contacting support).

### Usage Data
- We may collect information automatically when you use the App, such as your device type, operating system, app version, and usage statistics.

### Log Data
- In case of errors, we collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, and the time and date of your use of the App.

### Unique User Identifier
- The App generates a unique identifier for each user or device (such as a Firebase Installation ID or similar) to manage app data and functionality. This identifier is not personally identifiable information and is used solely for internal purposes, such as storing user-related data in Firestore. No explicit account creation or login is required from the user.

## Cookies and Tracking Technologies

The App does not use cookies explicitly. However, the App may use third-party code and libraries that use cookies to collect information and improve their services.

## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:
- **Google Play Services**
- **AdMob** (for advertising)
- **Firebase Analytics**
- **Firebase Crashlytics**

Please refer to the privacy policies of these providers for more information on their practices.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Provide and maintain the App
- Improve, personalize, and expand our App
- Understand and analyze how you use our App
- Develop new features and functionality
- Monitor and prevent fraud
- Comply with legal obligations

## Data Security

All data collected by the App is encrypted in transit using industry-standard security protocols. We rely on trusted third-party services (such as Firebase and Google Play Services) that ensure data is securely transmitted and stored.

## Account Creation and Authentication

Our App requires users to authenticate using their Google account (OAuth) via Google Sign-In. When you first launch the app, you will be prompted to sign in with your Google account. Upon successful authentication, a unique user ID is created and used to store your profile and app data in Firestore. This process uses your Google account's unique identifier, but we do not access your password or store sensitive authentication credentials. If you are already signed in, the app will automatically use your existing Google account session.

As part of the authentication process, we collect and store your Google account's unique identifier and basic profile information (such as your name and email address) in order to create and manage your user account within the app. You have the right to access, modify, or request deletion of your user data (including your Google account's unique identifier, name, and email address) stored in our systems. If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact us at the email below.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not** sell or share your personal information with third parties, except as required to provide core app functionality (such as analytics, advertising, and crash reporting through trusted providers like Google and Firebase).

## Your Rights

You have the right to access, modify, or request deletion of your user data (including your Google account's unique identifier, name, and email address) stored in our systems. If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact us at the email below.

## Children’s Privacy

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take necessary action.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
