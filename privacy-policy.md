- We may collect information automatically when you use the App, such as your device type, operating system, app version, and usage statistics.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not** sell or share your personal information with third parties, except as required to provide core app functionality (such as analytics, advertising, and crash reporting through trusted providers like Google and Firebase).
